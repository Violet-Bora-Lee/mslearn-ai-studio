<h2 id="create-an-azure-ai-foundry-hub-and-project">Create an Azure AI Foundry hub and project</h2>

<p>The features of Azure AI Foundry we’re going to use in this exercise require a project that is based on an Azure AI Foundry <em>hub</em> resource.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In a web browser, open the <a href="https://ai.azure.com">Azure AI Foundry portal</a> at <code>https://ai.azure.com</code> and sign in using your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick start panes that are opened the first time you sign in, and if necessary use the <strong>Azure AI Foundry</strong> logo at the top left to navigate to the home page, which looks similar to the following image (close the <strong>Help</strong> pane if it’s open):</p>

    <p><img src="./media/ai-foundry-home.png" alt="Screenshot of Azure AI Foundry portal." /></p>
  </li>
  <li>In the browser, navigate to <code>https://ai.azure.com/managementCenter/allResources</code> and select <strong>Create new</strong>. Then choose the option to create a new <strong>AI hub resource</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Create a project</strong> wizard, enter a valid name for your project, and select the option to create a new hub. Then use the <strong>Rename hub</strong> link to specify a valid name for your new hub, expand <strong>Advanced options</strong>, and specify the following settings for your project:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Subscription</strong>: <em>Your Azure subscription</em></li>
      <li><strong>Resource group</strong>: <em>Create or select a resource group</em></li>
      <li><strong>Region</strong>:  East US 2 or Sweden Central (<em>In the event of a quota limit being exceeded later in the exercise, you may need to create another resource in a different region.</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you’re working in an Azure subscription in which policies are used to restrict allowable resource names, you may need to use the link at the bottom of the <strong>Create a new project</strong> dialog box to create the hub using the Azure portal.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Tip</strong>: If the <strong>Create</strong> button is still disabled, be sure to rename your hub to a unique alphanumeric value.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Wait for your project to be created.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="configure-resource-authorization">Configure resource authorization</h2>

<p>The prompt flow tools in Azure AI Foundry create file-based assets that define the prompt flow in a folder in blob storage. Before exploring prompt flow, let’s ensure that your Azure AI Foundry resource has the required access to the blob store so it can read them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In a new browser tab, open the <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure portal</a> at <code>https://portal.azure.com</code>, signing in with your Azure credentials if prompted; and view the resource group containing your Azure AI hub resources.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>Azure AI Foundry</strong> resource for your hub to open it. Then expand its <strong>Resource Management</strong> section and select the <strong>Identity</strong> page:</p>

    <p><img src="./media/ai-services-identity.png" alt="Screenshot of the Azure AI Services identity page in the Azure portal." /></p>
  </li>
  <li>If the status of the system assigned identity is <strong>Off</strong>, switch it <strong>On</strong> and save your changes. Then wait for the change of status to be confirmed.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Return to the resource group page, and then select the <strong>Storage account</strong> resource for your hub and view its <strong>Access Control (IAM)</strong> page:</p>

    <p><img src="./media/storage-access-control.png" alt="Screenshot of the storage account access control page in the Azure portal." /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add a role assignment to the <code>Storage blob data reader</code> role for the managed identity used by your Azure AI Foundry project resource:</p>

    <p><img src="./media/assign-role-access.png" alt="Screenshot of the storage account access control page in the Azure portal." /></p>
  </li>
  <li>When you’ve reviewed and assigned the role access to allow the Azure AI Foundry managed identity to read blobs in the storage account, close the Azure portal tab and return to the Azure AI Foundry portal.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="deploy-a-generative-ai-model">Deploy a generative AI model</h2>

<p>Now you’re ready to deploy a generative AI language model to support your prompt flow application.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the pane on the left for your project, in the <strong>My assets</strong> section, select the <strong>Models + endpoints</strong> page.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Models + endpoints</strong> page, in the <strong>Model deployments</strong> tab, in the <strong>+ Deploy model</strong> menu, select <strong>Deploy base model</strong>.</li>
  <li>Search for the <strong>gpt-4o</strong> model in the list, and then select and confirm it.</li>

      <li><strong>Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands)</strong>: 50K <em>(or the maximum available in your subscription if less than 50K)</em></li>
      <li><strong>Content filter</strong>: DefaultV2</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Reducing the TPM helps avoid over-using the quota available in the subscription you are using. 50,000 TPM should be sufficient for the data used in this exercise. If your available quota is lower than this, you will be able to complete the exercise but you may experience errors if the rate limit is exceeded.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Wait for the deployment to complete.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="create-a-prompt-flow">Create a prompt flow</h2>

<p>A prompt flow provides a way to orchestrate prompts and other activities to define an interaction with a generative AI model. In this exercise, you’ll use a template to create a basic chat flow for an AI assistant in a travel agency.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Azure AI Foundry portal navigation bar, in the <strong>Build and customize</strong> section, select <strong>Prompt flow</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a new flow based on the <strong>Chat flow</strong> template, specifying <code>Travel-Chat</code> as the folder name.</p>

    <p>A simple chat flow is created for you.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Tip</strong>: If a permissions error occurs. Wait a few minutes and try again, specifying a different flow name if necessary.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be able to test your flow, you need compute, and it can take a while to start; so select <strong>Start compute session</strong> to get it started while you explore and modify the default flow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>View the prompt flow, which consists of a series of <em>inputs</em>, <em>outputs</em>, and <em>tools</em>. You can expand and edit the properties of these objects in the editing panes on the left, and view the overall flow as a graph on the right:</p>

    <p><img src="./media/prompt-flow.png" alt="Screenshot of the prompt flow editor." /></p>
  </li>
  <li>View the <strong>Inputs</strong> pane, and note that there are two inputs (chat history and the user’s question)</li>
  <li>View the <strong>Outputs</strong> pane and note that there’s an output to reflect the model’s answer.</li>
  <li>View the <strong>Chat</strong> LLM tool pane, which contains the information needed to submit a prompt to the model.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Chat</strong> LLM tool pane, for <strong>Connection</strong>, select the connection for the Azure OpenAI service resource in your AI hub. Then configure the following connection properties:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Api</strong>: chat</li>
      <li><strong>deployment_name</strong>: <em>The gpt-4o model you deployed</em></li>
      <li><strong>response_format</strong>: {“type”:”text”}</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modify the <strong>Prompt</strong> field as follows:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-yml"># system:

    <p>Read the prompt you added so you are familiar with it. It consists of a system message (which includes an objective, a definition of its capabilities, and some instructions), and the chat history (ordered to show each user question input and each previous assistant answer output)</p>
  </li>
  <li>In the <strong>Inputs</strong> section for the <strong>Chat</strong> LLM tool (under the prompt), ensure the following variables are set:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>question</strong> (string): ${inputs.question}</li>
      <li><strong>chat_history</strong> (string): ${inputs.chat_history}</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Save the changes to the flow.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: In this exercise, we’ll stick to a simple chat flow, but note that the prompt flow editor includes many other tools that you could add to the flow, enabling you to create complex logic to orchstrate conversations.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="test-the-flow">Test the flow</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve developed the flow, you can use the chat window to test it.</p>
